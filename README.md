- Paradise Lost is a community-based platform to allow users to build and edit their armies, find people nearby to play with should they want to opt into displaying their location, and make friends!

- This is my fouth milestone project as part of Code Institute's Diploma in <strong>Software Development (E-commerce Applications)</strong>.

- This project was suggested to me by my very close friend and fellow full stack developer, Simon W. He initially pitched this idea with me working on the front-end and him creating the back-end using Crystal, which is a programming language with Ruby-like syntax and C-like speed. I agreed to this but wanted to use this idea for my profolio project 4 due to it being something I'm interested in and it fitting the assessment criteria in terms of scope. As such, the back-end will be made of Python, specifically, Django, whereas the front-end consists of the usual trifecta of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- Inspired by Battle Scribe, which utilises an app approach and is available on both Google Play and Apple store (link to both). Unfortunately, many tabletop players have grown frustrated with there being close to no development in past few years and this has become a bit of an open niche and this will be my humble attempt to create a website that fills this niche and provides a hopefully useful service to any aspiring commanders.

- For the intents and purpose of this project, Simon W. will be referred to as the client as he was the one that pitched the idea and it will be my goal to facilitate and actualise his vision.
