|---  |---  |---  |---  |---  |---  |
| #1  | Background image only covering part of the viewport.  | Background image not covering the entire viewport.  | Background image was attached to a `<section>`.   | Attaching the background image to the `<body>`.   | [55c91aa](https://github.com/Ryael/paradise-lost/commit/55c91aa76922aa5140ef12f5f5cddbcc37591eae)   |
| #2  | Error message should be contained with the menu.  | Error message was causing the contents of the menu to overflow.   | The `height` was set to a fixed amount and wasn't accounting for any error messages that would only show up if the user input any invalid data.   | Set the `height` to `fit-content`.  | [0b0f056](https://github.com/Ryael/paradise-lost/commit/0b0f056cb71361212647bdf378550ac4c17144)   |
| #3  | Enlist Now button sends the user to the dashboard.  | Even after the user was authenticated, the home button still read "Enlist Now" and directed the user towards registration.  | The button link was directing the user towards registration as there wasn't any check present to see if the user was already authenticated.   | Check to see if the user is authenticated, and if so, label the button "Dashboard" and direct them towards the Dashboard.   | [3842db3](https://github.com/Ryael/paradise-lost/commit/3842db3d6d66fc0d4dfb4472def74ef786cb491e)   |
| #4  | All buttons disappear from view when the fullscreen navigation menu is opened.  | Buttons were still visible and accessible while the fullscreen navigation menu was open.  | The z-index wasn't configured, causing the buttons to remain on-top of all content.   | `z-index:0` was added to the buttons but later this would be changed to giving the navigation-menu itself a higher `z-index`.   | [bdb7f37](https://github.com/Ryael/paradise-lost/commit/bdb7f378ae2fd850edc51a3b3e9dec42d0574191)   |
| #5  | Roster name field fits nicely in the provided table.  | Roster name field was able to break the provided table and overflow.  | The roster name field's maximum limit was originally set to a max of 255 characters.  | The roster's name field was set to 20 characters instead.   | [99a5f89](https://github.com/Ryael/paradise-lost/commit/99a5f89b929be9014e72b68b4f33cc1f9ddd9976)   |
| #6  | Upon loading into the home page, all text is displayed as intended.   | A layout shift was occurring due to the dynamically changing text.  | The area where the dynamically changing text was appearing was unaccounted for prior to the Javascript causing the cycle to start.  | Adding starting text to that empty field. In this case it was just "ARMY".  | [d6166b5](https://github.com/Ryael/paradise-lost/commit/d6166b5e8511bb9211b473fc2d15db17b2e23faa)   |
| #7  | Database models should be singular.   | Database models were written as plural mistakenly and migrated.   | The typo was the main reason for this error.  | Rolling back the database table fixed the issue.  | N/A   |
| #8  | Unregistered user should not be able to view the dashboard, rosters, or any of its pages.   | Unregistered user was able to view the dashboard, roster, and all its related pages.  | No check was implemented to see if the user was authenticated or not prior to letting them view those aforementioned pages.   | Adding `@login_required` on top of each relevant `views.py` function.   | [25ee051](https://github.com/Ryael/paradise-lost/commit/25ee051ad5bc922aa24988da850176e631ea308a)   |
| #9  | Page titles should be dynamic.  | Page titles were static, set to just "Home".  | The page title was set to be just "Home" within the `head.html` template.   | Adding `%blocktitle%` to the base and updating each page with the relevant page title.  | [82113ba](https://github.com/Ryael/paradise-lost/commit/82113ba9416ef43bb9944f9618e8d19b8835718f)   |
| #10   | Rosters should be sorted by their name on the Roster List page.   | Rosters were sorted by the date created and then the date modified when they were updated.  | The rosters were ordered by their default, which was the date the were last modified.   | Adding `.order_by("name")` to the views function to order them by their name.   | [63f97b8](https://github.com/Ryael/paradise-lost/commit/63f97b83eb44642070ef44d36072755e4f475151)   |
| #11   | The logo link should only cover the amount of space the logo covers.  | The logo link to the Home page covered the entire nav element.  | The `a` element was placed outside of the `h1` element.   | The `a` element was placed inside of the `h1` element.  | [87a6300](https://github.com/Ryael/paradise-lost/commit/87a6300aef692d6e595d9dc160c9530dc255de19)   |
| #12   | No horizontal scrollbars should appear at any point.  | Horizontal scrollbars were appearing in some places.  | The width of certain elements was set to `100vw`.   | Changing the `100vw` to `100%` for the width.   | [b8f168d](https://github.com/Ryael/paradise-lost/commit/b8f168d3be274f173e10eb4afc0bb16c59536187)   |
| #13   | The button corner decorators should always stick to the very corners of the Home page Call to Action button.  | The button corner decorators were slightly off for the top and bottom right corners.  | The div `#cta-button` was caused the right side decorators to be misplaced.   | Removing `#cta-button` div returned the right side decorators to their correct place.   | [c9fc63c](https://github.com/Ryael/paradise-lost/commit/c9fc63c4fddd228e048b467a6f76957108b3140d)   |
